# DJANGO CODE CHALLENGE

This repository contains code that represents simple restful web API with DJANGO.


## Getting Started

These repo will get you an idea how to create a simple restful web API with DJANGO. We will walkthrough packages required, code behind how this works, and how all pieces connected together.

Overall Architecture:

### Built With

This project makes sure we have used the following packages and versions:

    ```python
        "packages": {
            django = "===3.0.4",
            djangorestframework = "==3.11",
            drf-nested-routers = "0.93.4",
            psycopg2 = "==2.8.6"
		}
    ```


### Estimated Learning/ Implementing Time

This project will use a simple and useful packages; but it would still be a good idea to log how much time I have learn and implement this so that you may be able to follow in later stage:

| Topic | Time (hr) | 
| :---: | :---: | 
| POSTGRES | 1 | 
| DJANGO with PIPENV setup | 1 | 
| Building models and migrations  | X | 
| Implementing DJANGO Rest Framework & DRF Nested Router  | X | 
| Complete unit test  | X | 
| Microservices demonstration  | X |
